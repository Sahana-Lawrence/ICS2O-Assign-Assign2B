        <ol>
          <li>After her graduaton in 1945, Jean Bartik was hired to compute ballistic firing tables for the U.S. Army. </li>
          <li>When the University of Pennsylvania completed a novel electronic device to compute firing tables automatically, she was chosen, along with five other women, to work on the new machine called ENIAC.</li>
          <li>The team, in which Bartik was included, taught themselves ENIAC's operation and became its, and the world's, first programmers.</li>
          <li>In 1947, Bartik became a part of a group that converted ENIAC into a stored-program computer. This was a major milestone that improved ENIAC's efficiency and usefulness.</li>
          <li>Bartik also made contributions to the early BINAC and UNIVAC 1 computers.</li>
          <li>Jean Bartik became a strong advocate for increased participation by women in science and technology. </li>
        </ol>
