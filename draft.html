        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Jean Jennings Bartik, born Betty Jean Jennings in Gentry County, Missouri, in 1924, was the sixth of seven children. Her Father, William Smith Jennings was from Alanthus Grove, where he was a schoolteacher, as well as a farmer. Her mother, Lula May Spainhower, was also from Alanthus. Bartik had three older brothers, William, Robert, and Raymond; two older sisters, Emma and Lulu, and one younger sister, Mable. In her childhood, Bartik rode on horseback to visit her grandmother, who bought her a newspaper to read every day and became a role model for Bartik for the rest of her life. Jean Bartik began her education in a one-room school, and she gained local attention for her skill in softball. In order to attend high school in the neighbouring town, she lived with her older sister, and she began to drive every day despite being only 14 years old. She graduated from Stanberry High School in 1941 at the age of 16. After high school, Bartik attended Northwest Missouri State Teachers College, now known as Northwest Missouri State University, and she majored in mathematics with a minor in English, and she graduated in 1945. Bartik was awarded the only mathematics degree in her class.She decided to study mathematics instead of journalism as she'd originally intended to do, because she had a bad relationship with her advisor. Later in her life, Bartik earned a master's degree in English at the University of Pennsylvania in 1967 and she was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Northwest Missouri State University in 2002.</p>

        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>After her graduaton in 1945, Jean Bartik was hired to compute ballistic firing tables for the U.S. Army. </li>
            <li>When the University of Pennsylvania completed a novel electronic device to compute firing tables automatically, she was chosen, along with five other women, to work on the new machine called ENIAC.</li>
            <li>The team, in which Bartik was included, taught themselves ENIAC's operation and became its, and the world's, first programmers.</li>
            <li>In 1947, Bartik became a part of a group that converted ENIAC into a stored-program computer. This was a major milestone that improved ENIAC's efficiency and usefulness.</li>
            <li>Bartik also made contributions to the early BINAC and UNIVAC 1 computers.</li>
            <li>Jean Bartik became a strong advocate for increased participation by women in science and technology. </li>
          </ul>
          Jean Bartik played an important role in the history of computer science, and she has earned many awards in her lifetime such as, <i>'Inductee, Women in Technology International <b>Hall of Fame</b> (1997)'</i>, <i>'Fellow, Computer History Museum (2008)'</i>, <i>'IEEE Computer Pioneer Award, IEEE Computer Society (2008)'</i>, and <i>Korenman Award from the Multinational Center for Development of Women in Technology (2009)'</i>.
